# SPOTIFIER! : CS109 DATA SCIENCE FINAL PROJECT

## Models

We used various models to explore the best way to identify the similarity between the tracks and predict similar songs, to be able to generate a final recommendation playlist. In modeling we included a sample dataset of 10,000 playlists from the 1 million playlists dataset. We split the sample dataset into a Playlist Bank and a Training set. The Playlist Bank contains 90% of the data (9,000) playlists and the Training Set contains 10% of the data (1,000) playlists.

More information related to model training and performance can be found on the [Conclusions and Results](https://heli18.github.io/CS109_Spotifier/results) page.
